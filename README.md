# ABOUT GHOST
**Ghost** is an operating system for the Intel x86 platform written
from scratch in C++ and assembly. It aspires to follow a pure
micro kernel design and do stuff as clean as possible. Some of the
important features are:

- multiprocessor & multithreading support
- window server, GUI with homemade toolkit
- patched GCC, OS specific toolchain
- custom libc implementation
- libstdc++ port
- extensive kernel API library (libapi)
- userspace C++ library (libuser)
- PS/2 keyboard & mouse driver, VESA video driver
- userspace filesystem driver support
- ELF binary support
- ipc mechanisms: pipes, signals, messages, shared memory
- named processes
- serial COM1 kernel logging
- virtual 8086 for BIOS calls

## Status
This is the bleeding edge source version of Octobre 26, 2015.
Version 0.5.0

- major kernel update
	- new scheduler implementation with waiting/running queues
	- internal interface of syscall handlers has changed
	- task state is stored on handler entry
	- clean-ups and fixes
- new, cleaned up window server implementation
- example filesystem driver updated
- PS/2 driver toggleable for IRQ or polling mode
- interface for process configuration (tasks now know their executable source path)
- new utils "lines" and "read"
- tests cleaned up
- read-directory fixed

TODO:
- bugfix: window server occasionally hangs up on command receival

## Structure
- `applications`
	sources for the essential system applications
- `documentation`
	about kernel concepts and features
- `kernel`
	sources of the kernel
- `libapi`
	sources of the userspace API library
- `libc`
	sources of the Ghost C library implementation
- `libuser`
	sources of the C++ userspace library
- `patches`
	patches & instructions for ports and toolchain setup
- `tools`
	set of tools that are used for development

There is an additional repository, the `ghost-sysroot` that is used as the
base for the filesystem image for a blank installation.

## Building Ghost
See the `patches/toolchain/TOOLCHAIN.md` for instructions on how to set up the
toolchain.
